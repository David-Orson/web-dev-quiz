Code Quizzer is a quiz website with Questions for people learning JavaScript. Users Can signup so that when they pass the quiz, their profile is updated to reflect that.

I decided to create this app as a challenge to myself by not using any video tutorials, mainly using documentation and Google for solutions. I want to progress my proficiency with the tech that I typically use.

Currently there is only one quiz available for users. I intend to implement multiple quizzes with more advanced topics.

I also want to take this as an opportunity to solidify the more theoretical concepts that I have been studying but seldom use, having read much of 'You Don't Know JavaScript' and am looking at advanced JavaScript Tutorials on Udemy. I plan to create quizzes that will challenge even the most seasoned developer as a fun way to develop my understanding of JavaScript.
